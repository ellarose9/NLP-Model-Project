Download the dataset from here. This was too large to add to the git repository!:

Things I have done to set up Python on my computer (feel free to do whatever works best for you, just sharing in case it helps!)

1. Downloaded Visual Studio Code
2. Downloaded Python (in a folder I could easily access)
3. Connected the two following these instructions (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-python-in-visual-studio-code)
4. Set up a git repository: https://github.com/ellarose9/NLP-Model-Project 
5. Learned about how to conmect my local files to git (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)
6. Now working on Data Exploration on my local Python/VS studion session. Will upload my exploration file to Git
7. There's also a cool project management feature in Git - would like to explore this more too. https://github.com/users/ellarose9/projects/1/views/1?layout=board
